"""Monthly date rules: "the Nth <weekday> of every month, HH:MM–HH:MM" in the site's time zone.

One rule engine (upcoming_rule_dates) serves both
  * the committee meeting — config/site.yml `meeting:` (e.g. 3rd Wednesday 19:00–20:00 Central), and
  * every entry of `recurring_events:` (e.g. the GV/LV booth at CityWide Dallas, 2nd Saturday
    17:00–20:00) — see build_data.recurring_events().

Dates are counted on the local calendar and each start/end is turned into a real instant with the
time zone's own rules, so a daylight-saving change (or a month / year boundary) never moves an
event by an hour: 17:00 Central is 22:00 UTC in October (CDT) and 23:00 UTC in November (CST).
An event that runs past midnight keeps its real end on the next day ("22:00"–"01:00" ends at 1 AM
the next morning) — MonthlyRule.span says when an earlier end counts as the next day.
