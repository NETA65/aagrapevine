//             and its app-shell cache — changes when the code does, not with each daily content sync
//   base      the site's base path ("/AAGrapevine/" on GitHub Pages, "/" on a custom domain)
//   shell     what is saved on install: styles, scripts, the two main fonts, the logo and app icons,
//             and the two offline pages (/offline/, /es/offline/)
//   save      the pages "Save key pages for offline" keeps, in the visitor's language: home, Meetings,
//             the Monthly toolkit hub (with the district report editor) and this month's page ({month},
//             worked out in the worker — skipped when it is missing), Contribute, Shop, and
//             Accessibility / GVR 101 (the hub and every lesson page) / the expense tracker when those
//             pages exist
// Registered by src/assets/js/pwa.js with scope = base. Served from the base path, so its scope
// can cover the whole site.
